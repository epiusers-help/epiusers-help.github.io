## Why Create a Wiki?

Because it is enjoyable.

Seriously, there are several reasons:

- Consolidate discussions from multiple sources
- Be able to tag and categorize content
- Teach people about [Documentation As Code](https://docsascode.org/) and DevOps using tools like [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/hugo/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)
